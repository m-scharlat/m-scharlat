- Hi there, my name is Mayer.

- After earning a degree in Business & Economics, I have focused my time and energy building a data analysis skillset.

- I mainly work with Python (Pandas), Excel, SQL and Tableau. But, I am always on the lookout for new languages, platforms, or tools that further my knowledge and skills.
