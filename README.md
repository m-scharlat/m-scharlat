- Hi there, my name is Mayer.

- I am a Data Analyst.

- I first learned to program on my own when I was in 9th grade and have worked with all different types of programming languages over the years.

- But in more recent years, after earning a degree in Business & Economics, I have focused my time and energy on learning the ropes of Data Analysis.

- I mainly work with Python (Pandas), R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. But, I am always on the lookout for new languages, platforms, or tools that further my knowledge and skills.

- Feel free to check out some of my portfolio projects!

- You can connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayer-scharlat/ or email me at mayer.scharlat@gmail.com.
